"General framework for interacting with a mailing list object.\n"
"\n"
"There are two ways to use this script: interactively or programmatically.\n"
"Using it interactively allows you to play with, examine and modify a MailList\n"
"object from Python's interactive interpreter.  When running interactively, a\n"
"MailList object called `m' will be available in the global namespace.  It also\n"
"loads the class MailList into the global namespace.\n"
"\n"
"Programmatically, you can write a function to operate on a MailList object,\n"
"and this script will take care of the housekeeping (see below for examples).\n"
"In that case, the general usage syntax is:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist [options] listname [args ...]\n"
"\n"
"Options:\n"
"\n"
"    -l / --lock\n"
"        Lock the list when opening.  Normally the list is opened unlocked\n"
"        (e.g. for read-only operations).  You can always lock the file after\n"
"        the fact by typing `m.Lock()'\n"
"\n"
"        Note that if you use this option, you should explicitly call m.Save()\n"
"        before exiting, since the interpreter's clean up procedure will not\n"
"        automatically save changes to the MailList object (but it will unlock\n"
"        the list).\n"
"\n"
"    -i / --interactive\n"
"        Leaves you at an interactive prompt after all other processing is\n"
"        complete.  This is the default unless the -r option is given.\n"
"\n"
"    --run [module.]callable\n"
"    -r [module.]callable\n"
"        This can be used to run a script with the opened MailList object.\n"
"        This works by attempting to import `module' (which must be in the\n"
"        directory containing withlist, or already be accessible on your\n"
"        sys.path), and then calling `callable' from the module.  callable can\n"
"        be a class or function; it is called with the MailList object as the\n"
"        first argument.  If additional args are given on the command line,\n"
"        they are passed as subsequent positional args to the callable.\n"
"\n"
"        Note that `module.' is optional; if it is omitted then a module with\n"
"        the name `callable' will be imported.\n"
"\n"
"        The global variable `r' will be set to the results of this call.\n"
"\n"
"    --all / -a\n"
"        This option only works with the -r option.  Use this if you want to\n"
"        execute the script on all mailing lists.  When you use -a you should\n"
"        not include a listname argument on the command line.  The variable `r'\n"
"        will be a list of all the results.\n"
"\n"
"    --quiet / -q\n"
"        Suppress all status messages.\n"
"\n"
"    --help / -h\n"
"        Print this message and exit\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Here's an example of how to use the -r option.  Say you have a file in the\n"
"Mailman installation directory called `listaddr.py', with the following\n"
"two functions:\n"
"\n"
"def listaddr(mlist):\n"
"    print mlist.GetListEmail()\n"
"\n"
"def requestaddr(mlist):\n"
"    print mlist.GetRequestEmail()\n"
"\n"
"Now, from the command line you can print the list's posting address by running\n"
"the following from the command line:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist -r listaddr mylist\n"
"Loading list: mylist (unlocked)\n"
"Importing listaddr ...\n"
"Running listaddr.listaddr() ...\n"
"mylist@myhost.com\n"
"\n"
"And you can print the list's request address by running:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist -r listaddr.requestaddr mylist\n"
"Loading list: mylist (unlocked)\n"
"Importing listaddr ...\n"
"Running listaddr.requestaddr() ...\n"
"mylist-request@myhost.com\n"
"\n"
"As another example, say you wanted to change the password for a particular\n"
"user on a particular list.  You could put the following function in a file\n"
"called `changepw.py':\n"
"\n"
"from Mailman.Errors import NotAMemberError\n"
"\n"
"def changepw(mlist, addr, newpasswd):\n"
"    try:\n"
"        mlist.setMemberPassword(addr, newpasswd)\n"
"        mlist.Save()\n"
"    except NotAMemberError:\n"
"        print 'No address matched:', addr\n"

"\n"

"            of information from the message: the address of the member the\n"
"            message was intended for, and the severity of the problem causing\n"
"            the bounce.  The severity can be either <em>hard</em> or\n"
"            <em>soft</em> meaning either a fatal error occurred, or a\n"
"            transient error occurred.  When in doubt, a hard severity is used.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>If no member address can be extracted from the bounce, then the\n"
"            bounce is usually discarded.  Otherwise, each member is assigned a\n"
"            <em>bounce score</em> and every time we encounter a bounce from\n"
"            this member we increment the score.  Hard bounces increment by 1\n"
"            while soft bounces increment by 0.5.  We only increment the bounce\n"
"            score once per day, so even if we receive ten hard bounces from a\n"
"            member per day, their score will increase by only 1 for that day.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>When a member's bounce score is greater than the\n"
"            <a href=\"?VARHELP=bounce/bounce_score_threshold\">bounce score\n"
"            threshold</a>, the subscription is disabled.  Once disabled, the\n"
"            member will not receive any postings from the list until their\n"
"            membership is explicitly re-enabled (either by the list\n"
"            administrator or the user).  However, they will receive occasional\n"
"            reminders that their membership has been disabled, and these\n"
"            reminders will include information about how to re-enable their\n"
"            membership.\n"
